The key differences HTTP/2 has to HTTP/1.x are as follows:

It is binary, instead of textual
It is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
It can use one connection for parallelism
It uses header compression to reduce overhead
It allows Server Pushing to add responses proactively into the Browser cache.
