HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. An HTTP header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. Whitespace before the value is ignored.

Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

General headers apply to both requests and responses, but with no relation to the data transmitted in the body.
Request headers contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.
Response headers hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.
Entity headers contain information about the body of the resource, like its content length or MIME type.

Headers can also be grouped according to how proxies handle them:

Connection
Keep-Alive
Proxy-Authenticate
Proxy-Authorization
TE
Trailer
Transfer-Encoding
Upgrade

End-to-end headers
These headers must be transmitted to the final recipient of the message: the server for a request, or the client for a response. Intermediate proxies must retransmit these headers unmodified and caches must store them.

Hop-by-hop headers
These headers are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection, and must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached. Note that only hop-by-hop headers may be set using the Connection general header.
